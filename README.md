***
__IMPORTANT:__ The most recent, cleaner version of the app is available on branch `refactor`. It has not been merged to `master` yet so as not to violate the terms of the agreement. However, if interested in the refactored and slightly tweaked version, follow the steps described in the __Using__ section but run `git checkout refactor` before running `npm run start`.

# ask-a-question
Ask-a-question is a piece of a user interface for a question-and-answer app. Built with React.js, it was an exercise in writing SPAs. So far, there is no back end for the app, but a simple Node.js server is being created for the app. The server will be available here: https://github.com/NancyBabich/ask-a-question-server. Once it's ready, the Using section will be adjusted to explain how to use the app to get the data from the server. Check for updates soon! Also, the app will be improved and expanded with time. See the "Issues" tab to find out more about what will be fixed in the first place.</br></br>

## Using
Run </br></br>
`git clone https://github.com/NancyBabich/ask-a-question` </br></br>
`npm install`</br></br>
and `npm run start`.</br></br>
The app will be avaialable under `localhost:8080`.
