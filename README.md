***
__IMPORTANT:__ The most recent, cleaner version of the app is available on branch `refactor`. This version of the app uses actual data from a recently created [API](https://github.com/NancyBabich/ask-a-question-server). At this stage, user cannot modify data. Also, this is the early version of the API and no authentication mechanism has been deployed yet; this and other more advanced features will be added soon, so, if interested, check for updates. Branch `refactor` has not been merged to `master` yet so as not to violate the terms of the agreement. However, if interested in the refactored and slightly tweaked version, follow the steps described in the __Using__ section but run `git checkout refactor` before running `npm run start`.

# ask-a-question
Ask-a-question is a piece of a user interface for a question-and-answer app. Built with React.js, it was an exercise in writing SPAs. The version of the app available on branch `refactor` is connected to an API; for reasons specified in the __Important__ section above, the version available on `master` still uses hard-coded data. The app will be improved and expanded with time. See the "Issues" tab to find out more about what will be fixed in the first place. Check for updates soon!</br></br>

## Using
Run </br></br>
`git clone https://github.com/NancyBabich/ask-a-question` </br></br>
`npm install`</br></br>
and `npm run start`.</br></br>
The app will be avaialable under `localhost:8080`.
